### **(V.4.2.11 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Optimization:
Slightly optimized natural mob spawning over time for RS's structure checks.

#### Config:
Fixed Savanna Mansion maps not showing up as a villager trade due to typo in config.
(Config should auto fix that one typo next time you run the game)


### **(V.4.2.10 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Config:
Added config/repurposed_structures-forge/map_trade_configs.json5 file.
This config lets you add any structure map to any villager or wandering trader's available trades.
Note: Disabling a structure will not remove the map from the trades. You'll have to edit that config to remove the map for the disabled RS structure.


### **(V.4.2.9 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Mod Compat:
Deep/Icy Dungeon, Underground Bastion's treasure room chest, and Mushroom Villages now gets imported loot.
Hopefully I got all structures this time.

Added End Remastered eyes loot to all RS Dungeons's chests, Mushroom/Grassy Igloo's chests, and to RS Nether Outposts's chests.

Turn off logspam about loot tables if Better Strongholds is on.


### **(V.4.2.8 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Mod Compat:
Turn off logspam about missing End Remastered loot table if End Remastered isn't on.
There was no issue with the mod or anything.
Just some logspam I forgot to turn off.


### **(V.4.2.7 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Mod Compat:
Added back compat with End Remastered. Their custom eyes should show up in some Repurposed Structures's chest loot now.
See here for what structure will have their eyes:
https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/blob/latest-released/src/main/java/com/telepathicgrunt/repurposedstructures/misc/EndRemasteredDedicatedLoot.java

#### Mineshafts:
Fixed End Mineshaft not spawning Minecart.

Adjusted look of the arch in End Mineshafts.

Fixed Ocean Mineshafts sometimes having Rails that aren't waterlogged.

Fixed Icy Mineshaft having Diorite Walls and not making support pillars/chains.

Fixed Crimson Mineshaft not having fences at times.

Reduces amount of Shroomlight in Crimson Mineshafts.

Reduced amount of pieces in backend that RS Mineshafts need in order to function. Cleaner this way.

Fixed support pillars for RS Mineshafts not replacing plants marked as replaceable that are water based/fire proof.

Tried cleaning up the wall states for Ocean, Desert, Stone, and Swamp Mineshafts.

Randomized removal of some rails in all RS Mineshafts for slightly better looks.


### **(V.4.2.6 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Mineshafts:
Fixed Ocean Mineshafts chests accidentally spawning Birch Mineshaft's loot tables

#### Lang:
Updated ru_ru.json file for Russian Translations. (Thank you DrHesperus!)


### **(V.4.2.5 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Mineshafts:
Ocean Mineshafts and End Mineshafts will no longer place blocks if it has an unobstructed view of the sky above.

Ocean Mineshaft's default min y config value is now set to 5.

#### Misc:
Tried doing a slight optimization to make sure RS structures do not do any checks for spawning if the world's biome source
cannot spawn a biome that contains said structure. Let me know if any issues arise. (Probably not noticable)

Fixed a rare null crash from my GeneralUtils.isFullCube code that is supposed to cache if a block is a full cube or not.


### **(V.4.2.4 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Now hard requires No Null Processor mod and NBT Deadlock Be Gone mod to help prevent issues during chunk pregenning or multiplayer gameplay.
These two mods fixes two nasty rare Minecraft bugs that impact structures/features. But it does affect some people so these two mods should help.

#### Bastions:
Changed default config value for Underground Bastions from 400 to 180.
You'll have to edit the config yourself to the new value if you already started game with any versions of RS older than v4.2.4.

#### Mineshafts:
End Mineshafts loot table no longer has Chorus Flower or Chorus Plant which is not supposed to be obtainable in survival.
Instead, it'll have Beetroot Soup and more Chorus Fruit as replacements.

#### Dungeons:
End Dungeons loot table no longer has Chorus Flower or Chorus Plant which is not supposed to be obtainable in survival.
Instead, it'll have Beetroot Soup and more Chorus Fruit as replacements.

End Dungeon's End Portal block is now replaced with Crying Obsidian.


### **(V.4.2.3 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Cities:
Changed default config value for Overworld Cities from 1200 to 180.
You'll have to edit the config yourself if you already started game with older v4.2.X versions of RS.

Improved Overworld City's resistance to lightning from thunderstorms.

Adjusted insides of two rooms in Overworld City to look a tad better.

Fixed some top pieces not spawning in Overworld Cities because of bad logic in my required/maximum count piece controlling code.

Fixed Bridge End pieces not spawning sometimes in Overworld and Nether Cities.

Nether Cities now always have 3 branches at minimum.

#### Outposts:
RS Outposts will not spawn near Overworld Cities now.

#### Ruins:
Cold and Icy Land Ruins will not let lake features spawn in them now.

#### Misc:
Fixed some processors that were placing blocks multiple times.

Fixed required/maximum count piece controlling code (for rs_pieces_spawn_counts) so it now limits amount of pieces properly and not cause weird behavior.


### **(V.4.2.2 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Turned off erroring on missing RS loot tables as I forgot to remove that debug code. Aaaaaaaaaaaa


### **(V.4.2.1 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Fixed crash due to missing refmap for mixins


### **(V.4.2.0 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Lang:
Added en_us entries for explorer maps to any RS structures.

#### Cities:
Added Overworld City! If you are lucky, you can find a map to one from a Wandering Trader! Very expensive tho...

May have fixed a bug that causes a very very rare chance of Nether Cities missing top pieces on their tower piece.

Replaced some full blocks with stairs in one of Nether City's steep bridge piece.

#### Pyramids:
Added Dark Forest Pyramid!

#### Ruins:
Added Cold Land Ruins and Icy Land Ruins!

Made the config default value for the spawnrate of Warm Land Ruins and Hot Land Ruins slightly less.

#### Igloos:
Added Mushroom Igloos!

Cleaned up the Igloo config file a bit. It will be reset to default values so edit the file if you want your igloo spawnrate changes back.

Made the config default value for the spawnrate of Grassy Igloo and Stone Igloo slightly less.

#### Witch Huts:
Expanded RS Witch Hit bounding boxes 2 blocks higher to better match vanilla's Witch Hut bounding box for spawning Witches and black Cats.

#### Villages:
Added maps to Mushroom Village to Wandering Trader's trade.

#### Misc:
Fixed some structures not properly avoiding water.

Changed all RS ConfiguredStructure registry names to match the base structure registry names.
This has no impact on player's worlds. It is safe. This is only for internal use or people creating their own datapacks replacing my structures for whatever reason.

RS Structures will not spawn now if they will get cut off by top of world's limit.

#### Mod Compat:
Fixed modded loot not being imported into RS chests.


### **(V.4.1.0 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Dungeons:
Deep Dungeons are now added that spawn from -10 to -60. Will replace Vanilla Dungeons below y = 0.

Nether Dungeon's secret banner is now red colored while Deep Dungeon has the dark grey banner instead.

Fixed Icy Dungeon configs not showing up.

#### Mineshafts:
RS Mineshaft arches should not be broken up weirdly as much anymore.

Fixed several RS Mineshafts having 1 incorrectly rotated arch block.

Fixed some arches placing incorrect blocks in RS Mineshafts.


### **(V.4.0.10 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Configs:
Changed the default config spawnrate for Mushroom Wells, Mushroom Villages, and Mushroom Pyramids to be more rare.
This is because Mushroom biomes are larger in 1.18.

#### Mineshafts:
Tried improving Mineshafts to have a bit less broken arches. More work may be done in the future for the other RS Mineshaft arches not affected by this change.

Mineshafts will try to make certain they do not place a ton of blocks in view of the sky even in rivers and oceans.

Attempt to try and make Mineshaft pillars and chains spawn better and 4 way pieces will now replace air to look better in caves.

Fixed Birch Mineshaft stairs not closing off fluids properly.

#### Outposts:
Nerfed amount of loot from End Outpost's Shulker Boxes and made armor/swords more uncommon.

#### Pyramids:
End Pyramid chests spawns slightly less Ender Pearls.

#### Strongholds:
In End Strongholds, reduce amount of loot Shulker Boxes being spawn just a bit.

#### Misc:
Optimized structure bounds checking for my mixins that prevents some features from spawning inside my structures.

Optimized the Jigsaw Blocks attaching part of my structure layout generation a bit.


### **(V.4.0.9 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Fixed incompatibility with Cyanide mod for good. Hopefully.

Locating stuff like Locate Command or Explorer Maps will now no longer spend more than 30 seconds trying to find an RS structure.
This time before aborting the locating can be increased or decreased by editing the locateMaxTime config in the repurposed_structures-forge/misc.toml file.


### **(V.4.0.8 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Configs:
Corrected configs to say that RS Mineshafts and Dungeons will NOT replace vanilla's.

#### Mineshafts:
Nether Mineshafts can exposed Ancient Debris again now.

Wall blocks in Mineshafts will connect to top wall properly now.

Mineshafts will be sunken into terrain a bit better to reduce destruction of surfaces.

#### Lang:
With special help from others, ko_kr.json is added and zh_cn.json is improved!

#### Misc:
Bumped mixin compat level to java 17.

Fixed a potential incompatibility with Cyanide mod.


### **(V.4.0.7 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Fixed rs_pieces_spawn_counts resourcelistener not actually hooked up.
This is required for specific RS datapacks to work properly and restrict how many added buildings can spawn in a single village to prevent overcrowding.
Example of this is the 1.18.1 More Villagers Datapack: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/repurposed-structures-more-villagers-datapack
This fix will make sure that datapack does not spawn more than 1 florist house in a single RS village.


### **(V.4.0.6 Changes) (1.18.1 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Hard require 1.18.1 MC and 39.0.0 Forge to help keep people safer.

#### Cities:
Fixed Nether City having some rooms with an empty chest instead of having loot.

Nerfed rate of Netherite Ingot quite a bit from Nether Cities loot.

#### Fortresses:
Jungle Fortress loot now has its tools and armor slightly damaged. The extremely rare diamond tools/armor is usually heavily damaged.

Fixed some Zombified Piglins not spawning in Zombified Crimson/Warped Villages.

Crimson/Warped Villages's tannery building now has Lava Cauldrons.

#### Dungeons:
Added rare chance of Otherside Music Disc to all RS Dungeons loot tables.

#### Strongholds:
Added rare chance of Otherside Music Disc to all RS Strongholds's hallway loot table.

#### Bastions:
Underground Bastion's bridge, other, and skeleton horse stable chest loot tables now has a tiny chance for Amethyst Shards.


### **(V.4.0.5 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

#### Configs:
Refined RS config default entries for Terralith compat

#### Misc:
Fixed issue where several structures could be placed wrong if world height is changed significantly in the dimension.

Fixed several Nether Structures being set too low and even inside the lava ocean.


### **(V.4.0.4 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

#### Configs:
Fix the autoupdating for configs to have best compat with Terralith not working


### **(V.4.0.3 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Fixed issue with deep copying the Structure Settings in chunk generators.
(This is needed to allow RS's dimension allow/disallow configs to work)


### **(V.4.0.2 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

#### Configs:
Autoupdated configs to have best compat with Terralith.

#### Outposts:
Fixed Snowy and Icy Outposts spawning in non-cold biomes by mistake. Should be better now.

#### Pyramids:
Fixed Snowy and Icy Pyramids spawning in non-cold biomes by mistake. Should be better now.

#### Dungeons:
Fixed Snowy and Icy Dungeons spawning in wrong biomes by mistake. Should be better now.

Fixed multiple kinds of RS dungeons unable to spawn in same biome when using config to force them into same biome.

#### Mansions:
Fixed multiple kinds of RS Mansions unable to spawn in same biome when using config to force them into same biome.


### **(V.4.0.1 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Fixed pool weight increase mixin not applying outside of dev.

#### Dungeons:
Fixed Ocean Dungeons not spawning because default min y config value was 205 instead of 20. Oops.
If you already launched the game in 1.18 with v4.0.0 RS, you'll have to fix the Ocean Dungeon's config entry yourself.


### **(V.4.0.0 Changes) (1.18.0 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
Ported to 1.18 and is in parity to 1.18 fabric version.

#### Configs:
Cleaned up, renamed a bit, and many range restrictions on some values have been removed.

#### Mineshafts:
Will no longer replace Vanilla Mineshafts. Will spawn just under the surface of biomes and some variants may spawn way up in mountains.

Slightly improved look of Desert and Icy Dungeons

Slightly buffed rates of Minecarts in all Overworld Mineshafts.

Nerfed Minecart rate in Icy Mineshafts to match rate of other Overworld Mineshafts.

Nerfed End Mineshaft's Minecart rates a bit to balance it a bit better.

#### Igloos:
Grassy Igloo and Stone Igloo basements and ladder pieces has properly randomized stone brick variant blocks and randomized infested blocks.
Amount of infested stone brick blocks was reduced a bit.

#### Mansions:
Icy Mansion pieces now has Polished Diorite under floor carpet to make traversing the mansion easier.

#### Strongholds:
End Strongholds have slightly less loot Shulker Boxes and slightly less Shulker mobs to
help reduce amount of Shulker boxes a bit that can be collected from this structure.

#### Dungeons:
Will no longer replace Vanilla Dungeons. Will only spawn above y = 45 in Overworld (Ocean Dungeon spawns lower to be under ocean floor)

Slightly improved spawner placement in Ocean Dungeons.

#### Fortresses:
Jungle Fortress mushroom stairs room has slightly reduced amount of mushrooms.

#### Bastions:
Underground Bastions spawn lower into deepslate area and uses Deepslate Iron Blocks in their Unit rooms.

#### Misc:
rs_spawner's json file now uses floats instead of ints so you can do fractional weights for mob spawner's mob type rates if you desire.

rs_pieces_spawn_counts folder is now added that lets you control what pieces in RS structures should always spawn and limit how often a piece spawns.

rs_pieces_spawn_counts_additions folder is created to make it easier for me to create RS datapacks with new pieces and have them not spawn excessively.

Added conditions to entries in rs_pieces_spawn_counts and rs_pieces_spawn_counts_additions files so mods can register a condition to
"repurposed_structures:json_conditions" registry and have their entries only apply if certain configs are on.

Conditions entry is also added to pool_additions json files and an option too.

Improved error message a tad when a required structure piece fails to generate.


### **(V.3.4.6 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod Compat:
Updated mods.toml so if Waystones is on, RS will require a newer version of Waystones if it is too out of date to prevent a crash.

Added piece limiting amount for RS - Simply Cats compat datapack.


### **(V.3.4.5 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod Compat:
Vanilla Mineshafts will not be removed by Repurposed Structures if Caves And Cliffs Backport mod is on.
This is because CCB added their own Mineshafts that replaces vanilla's so RS will try to not interfere with that now.

##### Configs:
Fixed a typo in a config comment.

Added thebeginning:.+ to the disallowed dimension config entry's default values to keep RS structures from that mod's dimensions by default.


### **(V.3.4.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod Compat:
Auto added vampirism:vampire_forest entries to RS's disallowedBiomes config entry to make oak village, oak witch hut, oak well, and oak outposts no longer spawn in that Vampirism biome.

##### Configs:
Adjusted wording of some config comments to be a bit more clear.

##### Igloos:
Adjusted code to make sure Grassy Igloos won't put falling blocks like sand as part of the structure's roof.

##### Villages:
Trying something new by increasing the bounding box of all RS Overworld Village's roads from 2 to 32.
This should make villages look better on mountains and hills and help reduce village roads or farms eating away the ground under houses. (In theory)

##### Misc:
Fixed a swallowed crash with the log spam filter if another mod causes missing structure piece type log spam with their own structures.


### **(V.3.4.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Configs:
Cleaned up RS configs to not be bloated with redundant comments and fixed a lot of incorrect/typos in some comments.


### **(V.3.4.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Configs:
Significantly cleaned up the config system backend code for my mod. Let me know if any config no longer works but it should be ok!

##### Mod Compat:
Blay's Waystone and Bountiful now cannot spawn more than 1 of their injected structure piece in RS villages. I did the restricting on my end.
(Note, Bountiful boards does not spawn in RS villages right now. They will fix it next update of their mod)

Blay Waystone's spawnInVillages and forceSpawnInVillages config are now read directly by Repurposed Structures and will control the waystones in RS villages.


### **(V.3.4.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mineshafts:
Fixed a broken End Mineshaft check so it now properly space itself from End Strongholds and doesn't deadlock /locate command rarely.

##### Dungeons:
Fixed Mushroom Dungeons basically never spawning. Oops.

Fixed a missing block from corner of one Snow Dungeon nbt file. (no user would notice any change so idk why I am listing this fix here lol)

##### Outposts:
Changed all RS Outposts to better match Vanilla Outpost that can spawn a ton of tents and cages and stuff in 1.17.
Yeah, Mojang made a change to outposts and no one noticed lol. I don't think it was reported anywhere.
As for why this change was backported to 1.16.5 RS, I did it because it looks so much better having more tents and stuff lol.


### **(V.3.4.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Woodland Mansions:
All RS Mansions now spawns pieces by using template pools. This means you can edit the pool files by datapack to
remove rooms you do not want to spawn. Or datapack the pools to make structure processors run for mansion pieces to randomize blocks.
Or even datapack using RS's pool_addition folder to inject new rooms into mansions!
Just make sure your new mansion pieces matches the size of the other pieces in the same pool.
No Jigsaw Block needed since Mansions are not Jigsaw Structures.

1x1_b5 room now spawns in RS mansions unlike vanilla which is bugged lol. https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-240121

Adjusted looks of Savanna mansion to make it look nicer.

Fixed vanilla bug in RS mansions where terrain can be found floating on second and third floor hallways of the mansions. https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-107594

Fixed vanilla mansion bug for RS mansions where there can be a hole in the second floor's wall to the outside if there's a 3rd floor above. https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-240221

Fixed vanilla mansion bug for RS mansions where there can be a 3 block high hole on outside wall right side where 2nd floor meets the 3rd floor. https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-110098

##### Outposts:
Crimson, Warped, and Nether Brick Outposts now can have target pieces with either Wither Skeleton Skulls or regular Skeleton Skulls.
The Wither Skeleton Skull piece only has a 23% chance of appearing for a single Outpost. Before, Nether Brick Outpost had a 50% chance of spawning one.

##### Misc:
Adjusted several loot table files.

##### Compat:
Added a mixin to undo a Charm's structure processor for non-charm buildings so that Charm does not break several RS structures that uses Data Mode Structure Blocks.


### **(V.3.3.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod Compat:
Adjusted piece spawn limiting for Tidbits compat datapack.


### **(V.3.3.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod Compat:
Modded loot will be imported into Better Stronghold Compat datapack's loot tables now.

##### Misc:
Fixed the structure offsetting to actually work for and only for RS strongholds so they do not get cutoff by world bottom.


### **(V.3.3.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Dungeons:
Added shulkerBoxInEndDungeons config option to let users make End Dungeons spawn chests instead of Shulker Boxes if set to false.
Configuredfeatures are unable to be overridden by datapack due to a bad Forge hook placement. Hence this config option as a workaround.

##### Villages:
Slightly adjusted look of Church (temple) piece in Mushroom Villages.

##### Misc:
RS structures that would've been cut off by world bottom will be offset upward so that they are now longer cut off.
(Helps prevents End-themed Better Stronghold from being cut off when using Better Stronghold Compat datapack)


### **(V.3.3.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Adjusted some zombie terminator pool files so that they are used now for many zombie variant RS Villages.

Adjusted many RS Village's terminator pieces to make absolutely sure they cannot spawn the wrong village's street to prevent other village's buildings from spawning in extremely rare edge cases.

Fixed Zombie Warped Village spawning non-zombified Piglins.

##### Mod Compat:
Added limit on piece spawning for future mod compat datapacks with Tidbits, Reosurceful Bees, and PneumaticCraft: Repressurized.
I'm just future proofing a bit.


### **(V.3.3.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Added Mushroom Villages for Mushroom category biomes!

Fixed Mountains Villages very very rarely spawn Savanna Village pieces.

Fixed Swamp and Giant Tree Taiga Villages very very rarely spawn Plains Village pieces.

Removed a lot of the randomly placed Red Sand blocks from Badlands Villages to make them look a lot cleaner.

##### Mod Compat:
Houses added to RS's villages from the official mod compat datapacks will now only spawn more more than once for a single village.
This will greatly help prevent RS's villages from becoming overloaded with multiple modded houses from the datapacks.


### **(V.3.2.10 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Lang:
Fixed several zh_cn.json translations.


### **(V.3.2.9 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mansions:
RS Mansions will no longer spawn at world bottom and will not make support pillars to the very bottom of the world.
This makes mansions spawn much better for floating island worlds.

##### Pyramids:
Many pyramids will now no longer make a support pillar to the very bottom of the world in worlds like floating island worldtypes.

Fixed several pyramid's check for terrain to check at correct spots for burying themselves.

##### Fortresses:
Jungle Fortress will now no longer make a support pillar to the very bottom of the world in worlds like floating island worldtypes.


### **(V.3.2.8 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
Slightly rebalanced loot tables in all structures to be a bit better.


### **(V.3.2.7 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
Improved the error reporting a bit if a datapack has a typo within its pool_additions folder for Repurposed Structures.
(If you were using the Farmer's Delight datapack or Environmental datapack from here: https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures/releases
Please go redownload them as the Farmer's Delight pack and Environmental pack were broken. They should work properly now and not cause crashes)


### **(V.3.2.6 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
Setting an rs_spawner json file by datapack to have no mobs in it or have a total weight
of 0 will now replace the mob spawner block in that structure/feature with an air block.
A great new way to quickly remove spawners if you don't want them in RS structures/features.

##### Fortresses:
Fixed Jungle Fortress spawner not being affected by the rs_spawner datapack. Sorry about that.

##### Pyramids:
Fixed Flower Forest Pyramid's top part from sometimes having stacked flowers.

Vanilla lakes should now not spawn inside Flower Forest Pyramids to help prevent floating plants.

Basalt Delta's basalt and lava features will not spawn in the Nether Pyramid for good.

Nether Pyramid is now in SURFACE_STRUCTURES generation stage.

##### Mineshafts:
Nether, Crimson, and Warped Mineshaft are now in UNDERGROUND_STRUCTURES generation stage.

##### Temples:
Basalt Temple is now in SURFACE_STRUCTURES generation stage.

Basalt Delta's basalt and lava features will not spawn in the Basalt Temple for good.

##### Ruins:
Basalt Delta's basalt and lava features will not spawn in Nether Ruins's area.

##### Outposts:
Basalt Delta's basalt and lava features will not spawn within the tower for Nether Bricks Outpost structure.

##### Villages:
Added a longer and bigger street piece to Badlands Villages so their larger temple piece can actually have a better chance of spawning.

Adjusted rates of some street pieces to help make birch, dark forest, giant taiga, mountains, and oak villages have a few more branching paths.


### **(V.3.2.5 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
Fixed crash if trying to use Java 11+ with this 1.16.5 Forge Repurposed Structures (forgot to do @mutable on an accessor mixin)

##### Igloos:
Grassy Igloo will no longer replace its blocks with air or fluid blocks if the biome's surfacebuilder uses air or fluid blocks.

##### Mineshafts:
Fixed crash if End Mineshaft is attempted to be spawned in a dimension where terrain reaches down to world bottom.


### **(V.3.2.4 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
Fixed a memory leak from the processor used on Grassy Igloos. The leak only happens if you keep finding Grassy Igloos.
Special thanks to BlueAmulet for catching this leak.


### **(V.3.2.3 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mod compat:
Turned off the surrounding biome checks for RS structures when the Hexlands II mod is on.
This will prevent using /locate or explorer maps on Jungle Fortress from freezing the game since there isn't a big enough area of jungle to pass the original checks.
Now all RS structures should spawn when Hexlands II mod is on and active. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexlands-ii


### **(V.3.2.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Mineshafts:
End Mineshafts now will try to spawn within islands a bit better.
The minY and maxY config for End Mineshafts was deleted in favor of endMineshaftMinIslandThickness config entry.
The End Mineshaft config default value for spawnrate was bumped up to 60 due to the new more restrictive terrain checks.

##### Dungeons:
Slightly lowered Ocean Dungeons default config value for spawn attempts per chunk from 5 to 4.

##### Shipwrecks:
Crimson, Warped, and Nether Bricks Shipwreck's spawnrate default config value has been changed to make them even more common.
The old config values will not change when updating so either delete the RS Shipwreck config file or edit the rates yourself to be 18 or 19.

End Shipwrecks treasure chest cannot have more than 1 Elytra and the Elytra is now more rare (from ~1/17 chance to now 1/20)

Increased chances of a lucky banner from End Shipwreck's map chest.

##### Strongholds:
Nether Strongholds library chest cannot have more than 1 kind of explorer map at a time now.

##### Ruined Portals:
End Ruined Portals chests cannot ever have more than 1 End City explorer map in a single chest.

##### Loot Tables:
Explorer maps in the RS structures now only have zoom level 2 or 1 to massively speed up creation of these maps in chests.
This is most noticeable with the explorer maps created in the End themed RS structures. May even prevent servers from stalling.

Changed the explorer maps in the RS structures to no longer skip existing chunks for finding structures.
This means maps may locate structures that you already found before but this should reduce the lag on pre-generated servers.
By now checking already generated chunks, maps should load much faster from RS's loot blocks.
If you wish for the maps to find unexplored structures again, download the loot table datapack from here: https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/0.0.11
Then change `"skip_existing_chunks": false` to `"skip_existing_chunks": true` for all minecraft:exploration_map entries.

Cleaned up the lucky banner pools in RS loot tables so that it is 100% vanilla now and the updated loot table datapack can work on servers without RS on.

Removed treasure enchant possibilities for tools in many non-End RS loot tables for better balance. (Mending is a treasure enchantment for example)


### **(V.3.2.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Configs:
Fixed config values not properly working for changing size of RS Mineshafts, RS Fortresses, and RS Strongholds structures. Should be working correctly now.

Added configs to allow changing of RS Villages size. Note, you will need to re-add the changes you have done to RS Village config for spawnrates if you edit it before.

Renamed netherStrongholdSizeSH and endStrongholdSizeSH configs entries to netherStrongholdSize and endStrongholdSize.


### **(V.3.2.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Loot Tables:
Added special "bonus_rolls" pool to all RS's structure loot! If you have a mod that gives you the luck attribute or luck status effect,
you may start to see certain kinds of new items in RS's chests! Especially new banner designs! Every RS Structure has a unique banner
so get a mod or datapack that gives you luck and start collecting all the banners! See what you can find when you are lucky!

##### Mineshafts:
Harshly nerfed the rates of Minecarts in all RS Mineshafts as it was spawning too many Minecarts.

##### Mansions:
Fixed Snowy, Desert, and Birch Mansions using the wrong loot table or had the wrong loot table path in the chests.

All RS Mansions storage room chests may contain loot, make the dirt room chest have loot, and fixed a non-moisturized farmland block for farm room.

##### Mansions:

Fixed potential problems that could arise internally in code if user is using Turkish language settings.
(Java's toUpperCase/toLowerCase infamous interaction with Turkish)

Fixed a possible crash if trying to spawn spawn certain structure pieces by Jigsaw Blocks manually placed by players.

##### Optimization:
Optimized many RS structures so they check their piece's bounding boxes more efficiently at generation!

Fixed Dead Bush not generating in side pieces of Hot Land Ruins

Fixed Tall Grass not generating in side pieces of Warm Land Ruins

Heavily cleaned up and improved the configs. They now exist in config/repurposed_structures-forge folder

Fixed some structures and features not working with the dimension/biome configs correctly

Added configs to allow dimensional/biome allowing or disallowing much better!

Added configs to control natural mob spawning over time in structures!

Added ModdedLoot configs so users can turn off Repurposed Structures's modded loot importing system easier for its structures.

##### Mineshafts:

Fixed Tropical Fish dying in Mushroom Pyramid's pit at generation

Mushroom Pyramid's pit is slightly adjusted to not be so cramped

Increase default chance of Nether Wells spawning.

Wells are more likely to have a Bell now.

##### Advancements:

##### Mod Compat:
* Fixed a check so that it checks for Better Dungeons mod instead of Better Mineshafts to know when to not remove vanilla dungeons


### **(V.2.7.9 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### RS Spawners:
* Made it so that setting a mob to a weight of 0 in an RS_Spawner file by datapack will no longer crash.
  Instead, that mob won't be picked anymore. I did add a more detailed error message if a weight of -1 or lower is attempted.

* Made empty rs_spawner files in datapacks now give a clear error instead.
  It'll still crash later but scroll up and you'll see the error msg explaining why the files need at least 1 entitytype with a weight of 1 or more

##### Mod Compat:
* Fixed possible crash with mods that makes their blocks implement IWaterLoggable but doesn't actually have the Waterloggable block property...


### **(V.2.7.8 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

### **(V.2.7.6 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:
* Decided to bite the bullet and implement the #7777 Forge PR into my mod directly https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/pull/7777
  I take full responsibility for any noise setting issues this cause for other mods but honestly, no mod should be negatively hurt by it.
  Instead, this PR-implemented-as-mixin will make Repurposed Structures's and a few other mod's dimensional whitelisting/blacklisting now work properly for structures.

##### Advancements:
* All advancements has been condensed. Now there's one advancement for finding all variants of one structure type.
  For example, you have to find and enter all Repurposed Structures villages to get the advancement for RS Villages.

* All 3 Nether Mineshafts have higher chance of Chest Minecarts.

* End Mineshafts have much higher rate of Chest Minecarts but also has far more Endermite Spawners to make it dangerous.

* Overworld Mineshafts are less likely to be cutoff by water and instead, will attempt to go through the liquid and wall it off instead.
  Ocean Mineshafts will do the same but for air instead.

* Swamp And Dark Forest Mineshaft has been split up into two separate Mineshafts. Swamp Mineshaft and Dark Forest Mineshaft.

* Crimson, Warped, Jungle, Dark Forest, and Swamp Mineshafts will have a higher chance of taller climbable plants in their 2 floor pillar piece so you can climb to the next floor.

##### Fortresses:
* Jungle Fortress is now a Jigsaw Structures so you can use datapacks to add new nbt pieces to it or customize it even more!

* Jungle Fortress's size and the height range it can spawn at are now config options.

* The breakage and decay in Jungle Fortress can be found throughout the fortress. Even in underground tunnels now.

  Their config default distance between spawn attempts was changed from 85 to 100 as well to spread them out a bit.

* Nether Stronghold is now in the last generation stage in order to try and prevent other structures from eating at the stronghold.

##### Outposts:
* Modernized all Outposts Pieces which should help make their small feature pieces spawn more.

* Expanded all RS's Overworld Outposts boundaries so that Pillagers should now spawn more often over time.

* Fixed comments on the RS Outpost configs being on the wrong config entries.

* Fixed Jungle Outpost not importing modded loot.

##### Pyramids:
* Added Jungle, Ocean, Giant Tree Taiga, Flower Forest, and Mushroom Pyramids!

* Added dedicated mod compat with End Remastered so that their loot appears in the correct RS structures now.

* Added a new system where multiple datapacks can add new structure pieces to any pool file!
  Instead of overwriting the pool file at
  `data\repurposed_structures\worldgen\template_pool\village\birch\houses.nbt`
  datapacks can swap the worldgen\template_pool part of the path to pool_additions like this
  `data\repurposed_structures\pool_additions\village\birch\houses.nbt`
  Now my mod will detect these pool files and merge its entries to the template_pool of the same path!
  This allows you to stack multiple datapacks using this systme without needing to merge their template_pool files together by hand.
  (Fun fact, this actually will work for other mod's template_pools too if Repurposed Structures is on)

* Now will be less likely to spawn off the island and will bury itself a bit.

##### Mansions:
* Fixed up a massive amount of RS Mansion pieces so that they look nicer. 
  (Also fixed some torches in Snowy mansion melting ice and fixed the leaf block that was decaying within the mini-tree in bedroom)

### **(V.2.5.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft) (36.0.25+ Forge)**

##### Mineshafts:

* Changed how translations are done for this mod and now you no longer need the translation datapack. 
  Just a resourcepack for your translations to take effect! This mod is now bundled with Spanish and Chinese translations files.
  The trick is that the English translations are now the keys for the other language files in order to make them work.
  
* Spanish translation provided by 16N1C0! Special thanks to them!


### **(V.2.4.7 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft) (36.0.25+ Forge)**

##### Strongholds:
* So uh, I just learned that removing the Vanilla Stronghold from all biomes doesn't actually stop it from spawning.
  To fix this, turnOffVanillaStrongholds config value is now set to true by default and it will now correctly make 
  Vanilla Strongholds no longer spawn anymore. Repurposed Structures's Stonebrick Stronghold will take its place properly.
  (Yes Eyes of Ender will find RS's Strongholds as well)
  
* Moved RS Strongholds from UNDERGROUND_STRUCTURES generation stage to STRONGHOLDS. 
  Will prevent some features/structures from breaking strongholds.
  
* Fixed Nether Stronghold Libraries having floating fire.

##### Outposts:
* Nerfed the enchantment range of armor and weapons in Crimson, Warped, and Nether Bricks Outpost's loot. 
  Armor and Weapons will be damaged now to encourage fusing gears together to repair and strengthen enchantments.

  All 8 Pillagers will not despawn and 1 of the Pillager has a Raid Banner.

##### Strongholds:

##### Villages:
* Fixed Zombie Badlands Village having 2 Birch Village houses by mistake.

##### Mod Compat:
* Adjusted Stronghold removal code to not conflict with Yung's Better Stronghold mod when he releases it!

##### General:
* Made all the checks I have for separating some structures from other kinds of structures now ignore those checks if the structure spacing is set super low in configs.
  Now if you make all outposts spawn in every chunk by config, Repurposed Structures villages will still be able to spawn.
  
* Made all hardcoded nether height structures now uses the chunk generator's maximum height. 
  So if you use a datapack to expand the Nether's roof, these structures should automatically now use the increased range!
  Some checks for Nether sealevel now uses the chunk generator's sealevel instead of a hardcoded value.
  
* Made all structures that checks surrounding biomes for valid biomes before spawning will now ignore that check if Checkered Biome Provider is used.


### **(V.2.4.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft) (36.0.25+ Forge)**

##### Misc:

##### Cities:
* Added extremely rare Nether Cities to all Nether biomes! Beware of the Blazes! Maps to this city are very rare but can be found in Nether Ruins or Crimson/Warped Cartographer chests. 

##### Ruins:
* Added Nether Ruins to all Nether biomes! They are a great source of maps to undiscovered Bastion Remnants! Special thanks to miguelforge for the design!

##### Mineshafts:
* Added Crimson and Warped Mineshafts!

* Tried to fixed Vines being improperly placed in Jungle and SwampAndDark Mineshafts and also added Leaves blocks to them for a more overgrown look.

* Changed Nether Mineshafts so they now carve into lava but places blocks to prevent floating lava. Tunnels should be less disconnected now.

  As a bonus, Basalt Delta's Basalt will not clog up Mineshafts anymore too!

##### Outposts:
* Added Taiga Outposts to non-snowy and non-giant Taiga biomes!

* Added Oak Outposts to non-birch and non-dark Forest biomes!

* Badlands Outposts can spawn on Badland's Plateaus now using a special heightmap check to not spawn it on plateau walls.

* Set default config for all Outposts to be slightly more rare to compensate for Outposts spawning in more biomes.

* Bumped default spawnrate of Birch, Jungle, Giant Tree Taiga, Desert, Badlands, Snowy, Oak, Taiga Outposts from 41/43 to 50 to make them slightly more rare.

* Fixed all Outposts spawning too close to vanilla villages.

##### Pyramids:
* Added Snowy Pyramids to snowy biomes!

* Bumped default config spawnrate of Badlands Pyramids from 20 to 25 to make them a bit more rare.

* Nerfed Golden Swords enchantment level range from 20-39 to 10-30 in chest's loottable for Nether Pyramids.

##### Fortresses:
* Attempt to reduce the amount of floating Vines in Jungle Fortress.

* Fixed Drowned not spawning in flooded Jungle Fortresses by removing them from the mob-spawning-over-time list and now just directly
  spawns some Drowned on fortress creation. These Drowned will not despawn and will sometimes have Iron or Chainmail armor.

* Fixed Fortress maps being sold in Level 4 and 5 trades by Cartographer instead of 3 and 4.

* Bumped default spawnrate of Jungle Fortresses from 32 to 50 to make them more rare.

##### Strongholds:
* Lowered netherStrongholdMinHeight config default value to 10.

* Slightly adjusted Stonebrick Strongholds so they now won't be added to None-category biomes.

* Replaced a lot of Cobblestone with wood in Oak Villages to make them more distinct from Plains Villages and made Path Blocks more common.

* Added zombie variant of Badlands Villages.

* Bumped default config spawnrate of Birch, Oak, Dark Forest, Jungle, Swamp, Mountains, and Giant Tree Taiga Villages from 29/31/33 to 38 to make them more rare.

* Bumped default config spawnrate of Badlands Villages from 23 to 30 to make them more rare.

##### Dungeons:
* Nerfed all golden tools and armor enchantment level range from 15-30 to 5-25 in Nether Dungeon chest's loottable.

* Lowered default config spawnrate for Ocean Dungeons from 6 to 5.

##### Misc:
* Deleted 2x2 Swamp Trees. They didn't fit this mod at all. They still exist in Ultra Amplified Dimension mod!

* Made Structure Blocks name field now hold 128 characters like Jigsaw Blocks instead of 64 characters.
  Now loading up Repurposed Structures's village pieces are much easier.
  
##### General:
* Cleaned up biome selection code backend a lot and adjusted some biome selections conditions for a few structures. 

* Fixed structure pieces being registered under minecraft's namespace. 
  You may see a bit of logspam about unknown piece ID in existing worlds but this will not break your world.
  It means old structure on edges of unexplored chunks might be cutoff. Just ignore the logspam.
  
* Cleaned up en_us.json file to be nearly alphabetical. 


### **(V.2.3.4 Changes) (1.16.4 Minecraft)**

##### General:
* Improved biome targeting so some structures types get the right biome better.

##### Outposts:
* Overworld Outposts now spawn Pillagers over time. 

* Replaced Dark Oak blocks with Spruce blocks in Snow Outposts

* Changed some blocks for the cages in badlands, Desert, Icy, and Snowy Outposts.  

##### Strongholds:
* Strongholds now will fit much better between the min and max y set in the config. 
  Rooms too low or too high will now be deleted (though the Portal Room will never be deleted).
  As a result, you may find a few rooms or hallways cutoff from the rest of the stronghold but that was
  a sacrifice I was willing to make to fix Strongholds sometimes spawning way aboveground than they should.

* Nether Strongholds no longer has Cobwebs in libraries and instead, may have fire.

* Strongholds will now not spawn in the End Dimension even when you add non-End category biomes to the dimension. With a datapack, you can
  add the RS stronghold spacing to the End Noise Setting and to the End category biomes to force the Stronghold to spawn in that dimension.

##### Villages:
* Badlands Villages now can spawn in Badlands Plateaus with a terrain check to try and keep them from generating on plateau walls.

* Badlands Villages now only contain Desert clothed Villagers instead of sometimes having Plains clothed Villagers.

* Fixed Birch Villages so they no longer have Oak Stripped Wood, Oak Fence Gate, or Oak Stairs.
 
* Fixed Churches not having doors in Birch, Dark Forest, and Oak Villages.

* Fixed Jungle Villages having Acacia blocks by mistake in the Weaponsmith house and fixed door in Butcher house being the wrong blockstate.

* Mountain Villages farms now have waterlogged Cobblestone Slab instead of Water Blocks to prevent them from turning into ice when too cold.

* Removed extra space at the end of addNetherStrongholdToModdedBiomes config name. (Will cause config to default back to true unless changed again)

##### Wells:
* Fixed crash if the wells nbt file ever somehow goes missing.

##### Dungeons:
* Fixed mob spawners losing their mob data after doing `/reload` or `/datapack disable vanilla` commands.

##### Mineshafts:
* Fixed mob spawners losing their mob data after doing `/reload` or `/datapack disable vanilla` commands.

##### Fortresses:
* Added Drowned to Jungle Fortresses possible mob spawns to help populate the water filled hallways below sealevel.

##### Backend:
* Structure spacing for RS structures set by JSON will now no longer be overwritten. 
  With datapacks, you can make RS structures now spawn more or less frequently as a result.

* Redid code on how mobs spawn over time are added to RS structures to be cleaner and less likely I forget to add mob spawns later. 

-Prefixed all my accessor and invoker mixins due to this bug in mixins that could cause a crash with other mods for same named mixins.

  only spawn Turtles if above sealevel, in light, and on Sand.

  Source: https://github.com/modmuss50/Voyager

##### Advancements:
* Advancements now have English translations built in so vanilla clients do not 
  need any en_us.json resource pack anymore! If you want clients to have different
  translations from each other, put Repurposed_Structures-Translation_Advancements
  datapack on the server and now each client can make their own en_us.json resourcepack
  for their own language translations.

##### Strongholds:

  addStonebrickStrongholdToModdedBiomes and allowStonebrickStrongholdToVanillaBiomes.

  1/9th chance to 1/5th chance. Nether Fortress is 1/3rd chance for chest 
  in hallway for reference.

##### Outposts:
* Buffed Nether Outposts's loot a bit.

##### Villages:
* Adjusted Dark Villages so they are added to biomes with "dark" in the name and is

### **(V.2.2.11 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Shipwreck:

### **(V.2.2.10 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Major:
* Register to Forge registry instead of vanilla due to a breaking 
  change done by Forge. Special thanks to andrew0030, dev of 
  Pandoras Creatures, for helping with fixing Repurposed Structures!

##### Outposts:

* Nether Outposts now has 1 Piglin Brute.

##### Dungeons:

* Ocean Dungeons chests will now have Prismarine placed under 
  them if they are floating. Should reduce the amount of 
  floating chests by a lot. 
  
* Removed floating plants from above Ocean Dungeons as best I can.
  
##### Misc:

* Giant boulders in Giant Tree Taiga biomes now are more varied in size.

* Default config spawnrate of giant boulders was reduced.

  
### **(V.2.2.9 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:

* Fixed typos in template_pools so that now ALL village pieces can spawn in villages!

* Fixed log spam about stuff being registered multiple times. Sorry about that!

##### Config:

* Dimension blacklist will now ignore any spaces you leave between entries in it.


### **(V.2.2.8 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:

* Fixed crash with some mod's custom ChunkGenerator.
  Just be careful to not use /locate in these custom dimensions
  as that could have a chance of causing the game to hang 
  depending on how they coded the ChunkGenerator. 
  Will try and think of some sort of solution to this...


### **(V.2.2.7 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:

* Added check to automatically blacklist any dimension using the
  FlatChunkGenerator (superflat worldtype) because that chunk generator
  will spawn all RS's structures at once and make /locate on certain 
  RS structure cause the server to hang forever.

##### Backend:

* Cleaned up codebase a bit.

##### Mineshafts:

* Adjusted the default config values for the maximum Y spawnheight 
  of Mineshafts to match the Fabric version of Repurposed Structures.

##### Mod Compat:

* Fixed possible crash with some biome mods if they do 
  strange stuff with their biome provider.

  blacklisting a RS structure from a vanilla dimension.

##### Igloos:

* Fixed bug where Grassy Igloos had 2 Villages and 2 Zombie Villages instead of 1 of each. 


### **(V.2.2.4 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:

* Used the registered ConfiguredFeatures for Horned Swamp Trees properly now.


### **(V.2.2.3 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Configs:

* Added config option to blacklist all Repurposed Structures's structures from
  any dimension(s) you specify. Finally figured out how to do it safely!

##### Major:

* All structures now will spawn away from themselves with spacing being between
  the spawnrate's number and half that number (in chunks). So a spawnrate of 50
  means the structure will not be more that 50 chunk apart from another and cannot 
  be closer than 25 chunks to itself.
  
* The 'salt' used for structure placement has now been fully randomized due to some
  weird quirks in Java's RNG that causes different structures to have similar effects
  from their salts if the salts are too similar.

##### Mineshafts:

* Made it so Mineshafts will not spawn in exact same coordinates 
  if multiple are added to the same biome.

### **(V.2.2.2 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Mineshafts:

* Overworld Repurposed Structures Mineshafts now still spawns and 
  won't conflict with Yung's Better Mineshafts when that mod is on.
  The Mineshafts will now be added to modded biomes of the right type
  even if said biomes do not have Vanilla Mineshafts. Use the config
  blacklist to prevent Repurposed Mineshafts in certain biomes.

### **(V.2.2.1 Changes) (1.16.3 Minecraft)**

##### Shipwrecks:

* Ah shoot. I forgot to add naturally spawning Wither Skeleton to the Nether Shipwrecks!

##### Misc:

* Load up some structure nbt files at world startup instead of during worldgen.

* Fixed registry names of all features (not structures) to not be in minecraft namespace by mistake.

* Organized all structure loottables file path. Will break datapacks still using old path.

* Organized config screen to say what entries does instead of hiding it in tooltips.

* Adjusted spacing between two different structures in many nether structures.

##### Shipwrecks:

* Added Warped and Crimson Shipwreck to their respective Nether biomes! 
  Special thanks to miguelforge for providing the designs and nbt file!
  
* Added Nether Bricks Shipwreck to all other Nether biomes! 
  Special thanks to cannon_foddr for providing the designs and nbt file!

##### Villages:

* Saloon spawnrate increased

* Fixed name of Nether Fortress and Bastion Remnant maps from Nether Villages.

##### Pyramids:

* Fixed Badlands Pyramid's trap not always fully activating.

* Adjusted the weights for straight roads and houses with beds to try
  and make Villages have more bed houses and not be just empty with only
  clusters of roads. Affects all Repurposed Structures villages.

* Fixed Item Frames with Potions missing from Saloons in Badlands Villages.

##### Boulders:

* Giant Boulders in Giant Tree Taiga Hills and Giant Spruce Taiga Hills now
  are place lower to fit on terrain better and their surfaces are roughed up.

##### Swamp Trees:

* Increased spawnrate of Horned Swamp Trees in Swamp Hills biome


### **(V.2.1.2 Changes) (1.16.2 Minecraft)**

##### Misc:

* Fixed crash with datapack chunkgenerators.

### **(V.2.1.1 Changes) (1.16.2 Minecraft)**

##### Temples:

* Added mixin to fix Mojang bug where Enderman spawners won't show Endermen in them and spam the logs to infinity.

##### Fortresses:

* Fixed bug where one type of crossing in Jungle Fortress would not get filled with water properly when below sealevel.

##### Wells:

* Nether Well's maximum height lower to 120 so it cannot generate on bedrock ceiling anymore.

##### Swamp Trees:

* Swamp Trees now gets added as an addition to modded biomes instead of replacing the other mod's swamp trees.

### **(V.2.1.0 Changes) (1.16.2 Minecraft)**

##### Major:

* Updated to 1.16.2!

##### Dungeons:

* Fixed crash on servers due to me accidentally using a clientsided method in the dungeon spawner code...

  instead of crashing when it fails to read the json files.

* Fixed giantBouldersPerChunk config minimum being 1. 0 Should've been the minimum so you can set very low spawnrates.

##### Mineshafts:

* Raised the default minimum Y height up a bit for several Mineshafts in the config

##### Shipwrecks:

* Made End Shipwrecks spawn more frequently.

##### Villages:

* Made Nether Villages slightly more spaced out by default in config.

### **(V.1.4.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)**
  
##### Config: 

-Added tags for the ores in wells. You can use datapack to override the default blocks in these tag files and even specify more than 1 block to use. All the tags are under data.repurposed_structures.tags.blocks and the files are called badlands_well_ores.json, forest_well_ores.json, mossy_well_ores.json, nether_well_ores.json, snow_well_ores.json. 

-Added tags for the plants/soil in Jungle Fortresses staircase room. You can use datapack to override the default blocks in these tag files and even specify more than 1 block to use. All the tags are under data.repurposed_structures.tags.blocks and the files are called jungle_fortress_staircase_plants.json and jungle_fortress_staircase_soils.json. Crops will be placed at a random age if they have an age property.

### **(V.1.4.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)**
  
##### Structures: 
  
-Added Grassy Igloos to Plains, Flower Forest, Forest, Birch Forest, and Dark Oak Forest! They can be hard to spot as they look like tiny hills.

-Added Stone Igloos to Giant Tree Taiga biomes! 
  
-Split up all Mineshafts into separate distinct structures in backend so now the /locate command can find specific types of Repurposed Structures Mineshafts that are within 1600 blocks of you! (the command cannot search further than that due to a hardcoded search radius in MC's code) Though this locate command won't find old Mineshafts in worlds made with previous versions of Repurposed Structures.
  
-Jungle Mineshafts and Swamp/Dark Forest Mineshafts now has Vines scattered inside!

-Changed Icey Mineshaft name to Icy Mineshaft.

-Locate command now lists Repurposed Structure's stuff as type of structure first and then the biome. Example: instead of jungle_mineshaft, locate command will show mineshaft_jungle instead.
  
##### Misc:

-Quick fix for a concurrent modification crash that I kept forgetting to fix........................................ 

   
### **(V.1.3.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)**
  
##### Structures: 

-Added Badlands Temple! They look similar to Desert Temples but are slightly more dangerous...

-Added Ocean Dungeons that can appear underground in oceans or on the ocean floor!

-Ocean Mineshafts are now filled with water by default and uses Prismarine Walls for the arch support now. They will now also generate through water in Ocean floors, water filled ravines, and water filled caves but will cut off before entering any air space.

-Ocean Mineshafts has Drowned Spawners with Seagrass around, Hell Mineshafts has Blaze Spawner with Fire around, Icey Mineshafts has Stray Spawner with Ice around, End Mineshafts has Endermite Spawner with Chorus Fruits around that will grow and block pathways!

-Slightly increased chance of a hallway being filled with spawner block or decorative blocks.

-Fixed bug where setting the useVanillaStronghold config to true will spawn Vanilla Strongholds that are missing Hallway Chests and Silverfish Spawner in Portal Room. These two blocks will now generate correctly.

-Moved a Nether Brick block that was placed wrong and basically broke the Nether Temple's puzzle mechanism.

-Wells now generates in the Surface Structures generation stage instead of Underground Structures generation stage. Players most likely will not see a change but it's better that it is in the correct category in backend.

-Fixed bug where Snow Dungeons were replacing Zombie spawners with Stray spawners instead of replacing Skeleton spawners.

-Improved registry names of custom structure pieces in backend.

##### Structures:
